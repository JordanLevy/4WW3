Note that I used Bootstrap, as well as JQuery.
The files for Bootstrap are in the "css" and "js" folders.
Also, my custom css file is "css/index.css".

I have the 5 required html files, as well as one extra "index.html", which just redirects to search.html. This is because azure considers "index.html" to be the main page.
